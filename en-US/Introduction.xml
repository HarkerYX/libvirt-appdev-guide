  <para>
    Libvirt is a hypervisor-independent virtualization API that is able to
    interact with the virtualization capabilities of a range of operating
    systems.
  </para>

  <para>
    This chapter provides an introduction to libvirt and defines common terms
    that will be used throughout the guide.

    <title>Overview</title>
    <para>
      Libvirt provides a common, generic and stable layer to securely manage
      domains on a node. As nodes may be remotely located, libvirt provides
      all APIs required to provision, create, modify, monitor, control, migrate
      and stop the domains, within the limits of hypervisor support for these
      operations. Although multiple nodes may be accessed with libvirt
      simultaneously, the APIs are limited to single node operations.
    </para>

    <para>
      Libvirt is designed to work across multiple virtualization environments,
      which means that more common capabilities are provided as APIs. Due to
      this, certain specific capabilities may not be provided. For example,
      it does not provide high level virtualization policies or multi-node
      management features such as load balancing. However, API stability
      ensures that these features can be implemented on top of libvirt. To
      maintain this level of stability, libvirt seeks to isolate applications
      from the frequent changes expected at the lower level of the virtualization
      framework.
    </para>

    <para>
      Libvirt is intended as a building block for higher level management tools
      and applications focusing on virtualization of a single node, with the
      only exception being domain migration between multiple node capabilities.
      It provides APIs to enumerate, monitor and use the resources available
      on the managed node, including CPUs, memory, storage, networking and
      Non-Uniform Memory Access (NUMA) partitions. Although a management node
      can be located on a separate physical machine to the management program,
      this should only be done using secure protocols.
